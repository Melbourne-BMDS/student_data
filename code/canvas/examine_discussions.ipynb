    "<p>As I hope you have learned through this class, healthcare systems and practices vary widely around the world and these differences are largely due to different cultural and political decisions made in each country. This variation is in addition to the biological differences amongst patients. Earlier in this class you met Angela and Rudi and learned a little bit about their experiences with a high risk pregnancy in the USA that ended in pre-term births of twins.</p>\n",
    "<p>I recently interviewed two neighbors, one of whom recently had a baby here in Australia using the private health system while the other is nearing the end of her pregnancy and has been using the public health system. Their pregnancies have been much more uneventful than Angela's, although Covid-19 has disrupted their normal course of care. In the videos I think you will find that all three pregnancy experiences are quite different, with a substantial difference between the private and public Australian experience.&nbsp;</p>\n",
    "<p>To help me better understand these differences, I reached out to a colleague at the University of Utah, <a href=\"https://healthcare.utah.edu/fad/mddetail.php?physicianID=u0976071&amp;name=lori-m-gawron\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Lori Gawron</a>, an obstetrician, and asked about standard obstetrics practice.

How they are collected also varies- even in EPIC [electronic health record] which has a number of prenatal flow sheet packages, not everyone uses them and often freetext notes. We routinely take vitals, weight, fetal heart rate, and fundal height, as the most reliably collected data and most evidence based. Everything else will be provider dependent as to whether or not they do it or document it, as data are less.&nbsp;</span></li>\n",
