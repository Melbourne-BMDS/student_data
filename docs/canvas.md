## Get Canvas Access Token

The first step to accessing your Canvas data is to get an __access token__. Instructions for this can be found [here](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/785215/pages/getting-started-with-the-api) on the Canvas documentation.

Here are some screenshots from my account showing the steps to create the token.

When you click on the generate token button, a new window will be shown which has your token. This needs to be copied and saved to a secure location on your computer; we will create code that needs to read this token in order to access your Canvas account. I put mine in a hidden directory in my home directory.
